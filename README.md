# My solutions for problems of [Advent of Code][adventofcode.com]

This repository contains my solutions for problems of [Advent of Code][adventofcode.com].<br>
They are not the shortest, the fastest or the smartest solutions.
Most of them are just some crappy code that I put together to solve the day's task.

Most of the solutions are coded in PHP because this is the language that I am most proficient into
**and** because PHP is a language very suited for this kind of programs.<br>
There are some solutions in other languages: C, JavaScript/TypeScript, Bash or [jq][jq]. Some of them are the only solutions of the day, others are alternative solutions.
